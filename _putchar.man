_PRINTF function formats and prints a series of characters and values to
the standard output stream stdout.

This was an assignment in which Holberton School students were tasked
into re-implementing the \f[V]printf\f[R] function with some limitations
given by the school.

.SS How Works
.PP
This function works by examining each character of a provided format
string, and then performing a specific action based on the character it
encounters.
The format string includes text that is printed as-is, and as the
function progresses through the string, it checks for the presence of a
`%' character.
If a `%' is found, the function checks the next character to see if it
is a specific format specifier.
If a format specifier is found, the function replaces it with the
corresponding text provided as additional parameters.
If the next character is another `%', the function simply prints a
single `%' character.
If the character following the `%' is neither a format specifier nor
another `%', the function prints the `%' character followed by the next
character as-is.

.SS Format Specifications
.PP
Format specifiers are characters that start with the % sign, followed by
a character that indicates the type of data that will be printed.
For example, %d is used to print a decimal integer, %f to print a
floating-point number, %s to print a string of characters, among others.
.PP
In addition to the data type, format specifiers can also include
additional information to control the way the data is formatted.
For example, %6d will print a decimal integer with a minimum width of 6
characters, and %0.2f will print a floating-point number with two
decimal places.
.PP
_printf function uses format specifiers to specify the type and format
of data that will be printed on the screen or to an output file.
